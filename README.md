Indego Bike Share Python3 Library
==============================

About
-----

I am mostly fooling around with Python3 to try learning it along with familiarizing myself with object-orientation.

I created this in almost an identical way to [my existing Indego PHP library](https://github.com/ericoc/indego-php-lib).

More to come here soon.

Check out [the City of Philadelphia GitHub](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia) if you think this library is interesting!
